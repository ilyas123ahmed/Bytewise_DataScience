# Topic: What is data science?
 Data Science is the field of study which aims to extract insights and useful information from raw data. This information can be used in several ways; make better decisions, predict future data points, discover patterns, and much more. Data Science helps answer a lot of our daily questions, be it finding the fastest route to our destinations or giving movie recommendations. It does this by analyzing existing data and modeling it using a certain algorithm. For example, past weather data can be fed to a model, and it can accurately predict the weather of the next few days to a certain degree of accuracy.
 
## Need for data science?
 Many people are died in road accidents due to a lack of knowledge or not following proper rules. That’s why we move towards the self-driving car to reduce the causalities or loss.

Another example like flight system, almost everyone faces the problem of delays in flight due the unpredictable weather example, we can overcome the problems like over-speed, unpredictable weather, when to stop a car, and when to fly by involving data science to fly by using data sciencewe can overcome, the problems. With data science it is possible to predict such unpredictable circumstances.
By using data science we can,

  ### Route planning:
 For self-driving cars, it means which road is best to reach out to the final destination. Which 
route is best to reach at minimum time? Predictive analytics: In which we predict what to do if this happens or not. Like if the red signal is on then we must 
stop the car etc.

Time and distance are the inputs in this example. We give the input data to our model and they 
predict the best possible option for us on the basis of time and distance.
In this way, we can save our time, money, etc.


 ### Pattern discovery:
For example, we collect data for one year from mart, in which some sales are very high throughout the whole year, some are low, and some are on average. After one year this will create some patterns we can also apply data science to these patternsto predict or improve their sales.


## What is data science?
Devising and applying models and algorithms to mine the stores of big data. Analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends. Interpreting the data to discover solutions and opportunities.Communicating findings to stakeholders using visualization and other means. Process of data science:Asking the right question and exploring the data.You identify the problems, explore the data, and then purify the data for our model. Modeling the data by using algorithms.Which model to use, which algorithm to use, after planning the algorithms and model train the data and test the data iteratively until you got the result.


 ## Communicating with stakeholders and visualizing the results:
 In the end communicate with stakeholders and tell them about their achievement’s and 
Business intelligence vs Data Science:

### 1. Data source:
Business intelligence
Structured data in business. Like we get data from different table sources to putt in a uniform way.

 Data Science
Un-Structured data in data science. Like we get data from different table/excel sources as well as in the 
comment form/ feedback.


### 2. Method:
 Business intelligence
Analytical:
In a sense, we just get data and give them output whatever the output is. Like historical data.

 Data Science
Scientific:
 We go beyond the depth of data why this happen or not.


### 3. Skills:
 Business intelligence
Statistics, visualization.

 Data Science
Statistics, visualization, and machine learning


### 4. Focus:
 Business intelligence
Past, present.

 Data Science
Present data and future predictions.


## Prerequisites:
The curiosity of asking questions
Common sense towards the best solution.
Good communication skills to demonstrate their findings  Machine learning

 Mathematical models 
 Statistics
 Computer programming
 Databases


## What does a data scientist do?

 We get some problems, then we collect some raw data, then process it 
and analyze the model, after this, we get some meaningful data and 
useful models and results.

### Data science lifecycle with an example:
 
### Concept study
Understanding the business problem, asking questions to stakeholders, getting an understanding of the business model, and understanding the data available.In which the end goal involve, the budget involves, etc.

### Data preparation:
 In which we mung or manipulate the raw data to useful data. This is avery crucial and important step of data science.

### Model planning:
In which we select the model and algorithms we use.

### Model building:
 In which we train our model and then test the model. We repeat thesesteps iteratively until we get successful result.And then visualize this model to chart for better understanding.

### Communication:
At last communicate with stakeholders and presented the findings.Operationalize: Final report, code and technical documents are delivered to thestakeholder.
