# PYTHON BASICS 
# Your First Python Program
  print() can be used to output or dispaly any kind of text in the console window.This function will use to print our first program in python
  
  ```PYTHON
   print('I am ILYAS AHMED')
  ```
# Variables
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

## Rules for Python variables:
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

```python
num = 5
name = "Ilyas"
print(num)
print(name)
```
In python we dont need to specify their type but If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
```python
 x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
 y = int(3)    # y will be 3
 z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```
## Many Values to Multiple Variables
 Python allows us to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
```python
 x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
 x = y = z = "Orange"

```

## Global and Local Variables 
Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.



# Receiving Input

Python allows for user input.That means we are able to ask the user for input.we can take input from user or ask from user by input() function.
```python
 username = input("Enter username: ")
 print("Username is: " + username)
```

# Type Conversion
 There are 3 main data types in python:

- Numeric like 64 or 9.99
- Textual like 'D' or "ilyas"
- Boolean like True or False
They can be converted between each other in python. 
For example, an integer can be converted into a string like this,
```pyhton
 num = 34
 string = str(num)
 print(type(string))
```

```pyhton
 'str'
```
