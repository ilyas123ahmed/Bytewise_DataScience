## What is Natural Language Processing(NLP)?
- NPL is a branch of computer science and specifiaclly branch o f artificial intelligence.
- NLP involves making computers to perform useful tasks with the natural languages humans use.
- NPL giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in the same way human beings can.
- NLP involves communication between humans and machines using natural language like english etc.
- In NPL we communicate with machine in such a way like we send a message in text or in the form of voice to computing device and then device gave response back.

## Applications of NLP

- Sentiment Analysis
- Text Classification
- Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
- Text Extraction
- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- Market Intelligence
- Auto-Correct
- Intent Classification
- Urgency Detection
- Speech Recognition

## Components of NLP

- Natural Language Understanding(NLU)
- Natural Language Generation(NLG)

### - Natural Language Understanding(NLU)
- It help machine to understand the intention of user.
- It interpret the data enter by user and get the meaning of user what he want to say? 
- Analyzing different aspects of the language.

#### Lexical ambiguity
- In this phase text is divided in sepearte junks.
- Each junk have multiple meaning in their own perspective.
- like i went to the school.here school have multiple meanings

#### Syntatic ambiguity
Ambiguity in their structure.
Old man and women are above than 60 years.
In this example it is difficult for machine to understand either they are talking about old man and women or both.

#### Semantic ambiguity
Ambiguity in their meaning.
- Retrieves the possible meanings of a sentence that is clear and semantically correct. Its process of retrieving meaningful insights from text.
For example, ILYAS wants it.

In the above statement, we can clearly see that the “it” keyword does not make any sense. In fact, it is referring to anything that we don’t know. That is nothing but this “it” word depends upon the previous sentence which is not given. So once we get to know about “it”, we can easily find out the reference.
#### Pragmatic ambiguity
- In which context of the sentence gives the multiple interpretation.
The police are coming.
-There are multiples interpretations of above sentence.Why police is coming?, Where is coming? etc.


### Natural Language Generation(NLG)
- In this part of NLP machine generating the output in a natural language based on the input provided by the user.
- The output is come in a language is same as input given by user in which language
